# Python Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Portfolio! This repository showcases my journey in learning and applying Python for various data science projects. I have completed the "Python for Applied Data Science and AI" course on Coursera, and I am eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. This README will be updated with projects and detailed descriptions as I progress.

## Introduction

I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong background in SQL and a keen interest in Python programming and data analysis. This portfolio is a collection of my work as I continue to refine my skills and apply them to real-world scenarios. With a solid foundation in SQL and a growing proficiency in Python, I aim to build projects that showcase my ability to analyze data and derive meaningful insights to solve complex problems. My goal is to leverage my expertise in SQL and Python to contribute effectively to data-driven decision-making processes.

## Completed Course

### Python for Applied Data Science and AI

I have completed the [Python for Applied Data Science and AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai/home/week/1) course on Coursera, which is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. This course covered:

- Python basics
- Data structures
- Data analysis with Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Machine learning with Scikit-learn

Through this course, I gained a strong foundation in Python and applied data science techniques, which I will demonstrate in my projects.
